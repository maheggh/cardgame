the .gitignore file was missing the first time i pushed to github for some reason so i had to add it in later. sorry about that

I saved the mongoDB database files in their own folder.

Icons have been added as their own collection that cards can refer to do, as of now they simply point to fictional filepaths but it can easily be retooled to store svg data or similar.

backend is split into routes -> controllers -> schemas to seperate functionality, and keep code more manageable

some parts of the task were left open so i took liberties with my implementation (such as the part about the icons, as well as how the collections are constructed)

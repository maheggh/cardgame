- Card CSS (and some HTML) mostly borrowed from here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGVXmoZWZuw

- Changed some of the original css just because i wanted to display the number of the card as well. Also styled the original page slightly differently

- I could not for the life of me understand how we we're expected to recolor the cards so i decided to do it using the css filter by allowing you to input a hexcode as the attribute "card-color";

- I've also referenced a similar oblig i did in 2022, though not copying it directly.

- Code borrowed from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51573435/want-to-add-addeventlistener-on-multiple-elements-with-same-class to add event listeners to multiple buttons

- I couldn't figure out what was meant by making the cards configurable using "js properties" so i went ahead and pre-did the optional task in case I failed the assignment
